# Programme-Financial-Health-Dashboard-
## Project Overview

This project presents a Programme Financial Health Check Dashboard that provides a comprehensive financial and delivery performance overview of a multi-project programme portfolio for the year 2025.
The dashboard is designed to support programme managers, finance officers, and senior leadership in monitoring delivery progress, assessing forecast accuracy, and identifying financial and implementation risks across projects. It integrates forecasted budgets, actual delivery, burn rates, and cash positions to enable evidence-based decision-making and proactive programme management.
## Business Problem
•	Managing large programme portfolios is complex due to:
•	Variances between forecasted budgets and actual delivery
•	Limited visibility into burn rates and cash balances
•	Misalignment between project timelines and financial execution
•	Difficulty identifying under-performing or high-risk projects early.
## Objective
•	To develop a single, integrated dashboard that enables decision-makers to:
•	Track delivery against forecasts
•	Monitor financial execution efficiency
## The dataset used in this portfolio project consists of programme- and project-level financial and operational data, including:
•	Project IDs and descriptions
•	Approved budgets
•	Forecast delivery amounts (2025)
•	Actual delivery and expenditure
•	Commitments and remaining balances
•	Revenue and cash balance per project
•	Project duration, elapsed months, and remaining months
•	Identify cash flow and burn-rate risks
•	Compare time progress vs financial delivery at project level
## KPIs & Methodology
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
•	Forecast Amount (2025): 44.2M
•	Delivery as of Today: 31.6M
•	Delivery Rate: 71.45%
•	Management Fee (as of Today): 1.8M
•	Burn Rate (%)
•	Cash Balance
•	Time Progress (%) vs Financial Delivery (%)
## Methodology
•	Cleaned and standardized financial and project datasets
•	Built a structured data model linking projects, time periods, and financial measures
•	Created calculated metrics for delivery, variance, burn rate, and progress
•	Developed quarterly and monthly comparisons for forecast vs actual delivery
•	Validated outputs against aggregated totals and financial controls
## Key insights generated from the dashboard include:
Overall programme delivery stands at 71.45% of the 2025 forecast
•	Quarterly and monthly analysis highlights periods of under- and over-performance, supporting corrective action
•	Several projects show high time progress but lower financial delivery, indicating implementation risk
•	Some projects exceed forecast delivery, signaling potential budget pressure
•	Burn-rate and cash-balance analysis flags projects with liquidity risks or slow fund utilization
•	These insights support early intervention, re-forecasting, and stronger programme oversight.
## Tools & Skills Demonstrated
•	Looker Studio – Data modeling, Field calculations, and dashboard development
•	Data Analytics Techniques:
•	Financial KPI design
•	Forecast vs actual variance analysis
•	Burn-rate and cash-flow analysis
•	Dashboard storytelling for executive audiences
